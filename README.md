# SIEM TUTORIAL | Microsoft Sentinel HeatMAP with LIVE CYBER ATTACKS (put this on your resume)
### Learning Objectives:
1. Provisioning and deprovisioning virtual enviornments within Azure.
2. Third-party API calls.
3. Security Information and Event Management - log anaylyis and visualization. 



### Technologies and Protocols:
* Microsft Azure - a cloud computing service operated by Microsoft for application management via Microsoft-managed data centers
* Services within Azure: Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel (Mircosoft's SIEM)
* Powershell 
 
### Overview:

> Step-by-step overview of lab:
1. Create Azure subscription (FREE $200 credits)
2. Create virtual machine in Azure (honeypot-vm) > turn firewalls off (making it vulnerable to brute force attacks) 
3. Use a Powershell script to extract  IP of attackers > feed IP into third party API and return back to honeypot-vm specific location information.
4.  Create log repository in Azure (Log Analytics Workspace) - this will ingest our logs from honeypot-vm
5. Set up Sentinel - Microsoftâ€™s cloud native SIEM
6. Use data from SIEM to map out attacker information and magnitude
